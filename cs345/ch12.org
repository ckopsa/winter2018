** TODO 3.	(3) What is the purpose of the command interpreter?
*** TODO Why is it usually separate from the kernel?
*** TODO Would it be possible for the user to develop a new command interpreter using the system-call interface provided by the operating system?
** TODO 4.	(3) What are the two models of interprocess communication?
*** TODO What are the strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches?
** TODO 5.	(4.5) What are the advantages of the microkernel approach to system design?
*** TODO How do user programs and system services interact in a microkernel architecture?
*** TODO What are the disadvantages of using the microkernel approach?
