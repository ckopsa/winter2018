* DONE Homework 1 [9/9]
  CLOSED: [2018-01-20 Sat 11:41]
** DONE 1. (2) What is multiprogramming and what is it used for?
   CLOSED: [2018-01-08 Mon 11:56]
   Multiprogramming is organizing jobs so that the CPU always has one to execute.

   Multiprogramming is used for increased CPU utilization.
** DONE 2. (2) What are some advantages of multiprocessor systems?
   CLOSED: [2018-01-08 Mon 11:46]
   - Increased throughput - more work done in less time
   - Economy of scale - Because they can share resources the can cost less
   - Increased reliability - properly distributed tasks over several processes
     can fail and allow other processors to pick up the remaining tasks,
     graceful degradation
** DONE 3. (3) How do clustered systems differ from multiprocessor systems?
   CLOSED: [2018-01-08 Mon 11:56]
   Clustered systems differ from the multiprocessor systems in that they are
   composed of two or more individual systems - or nodes - joined together.
*** DONE What is required for two machines belonging to a cluster to cooperate to provide a highly available service?
    CLOSED: [2018-01-08 Mon 11:56]
    Redundancy in the systems.
** DONE 4. (3) Why are caches useful?
   CLOSED: [2018-01-08 Mon 15:04]
   Caches provide quicker access to data by buffering the data from a slower
   storage.
*** DONE What problems do caches cause?
    CLOSED: [2018-01-08 Mon 15:04]
    cache coherency - this occurs when data between caches becomes out-of-sync.
*** DONE If a cache can be made as large as the device for which it is caching (for instance, a cache as large as a disk), why not make it that large and eliminate the device? Provide any assumptions or conditions that your answer is based on.
    CLOSED: [2018-01-08 Mon 15:04]
    The cache can be made as large as the device assuming that the cache
    maintains the same storage properties as the device and also assuming that
    the cache is comparable in cost.
** DONE 5. (3) Indicate which following types of operating systems, Time sharing (T), Real time (R), Handheld (H) match with the following properties:
   CLOSED: [2018-01-10 Wed 11:49]
   Uses CPU scheduling and multiprogramming to provide interactive use of a
   system for many users. - Time Sharing

   An operating system used for a few dedicated end-user applications. - Real Time

   The CPU switches rapidly from one user to another. - Time Sharing

   Reads information from sensors and must respond in a fixed amount of time. -
   Real time

   Often found as part of the control system for a device or system. - Real Time
   
   An operating system for a device with a small amount of memory, small
   display and often, a slow processor. - Handheld
** DONE 6. (3) What is the purpose of interrupts?
   CLOSED: [2018-01-10 Wed 11:34]
   To notify the CPU when a device becomes ready for service. 
*** What are the differences between a trap and an interrupt?
    Interrupts are from hardware and traps are from software.
*** Can traps be generated intentionally by a user program? If so, for what purpose?
    Traps are used to execute system calls from software.
** DONE 7. (2) What are the advantages and disadvantages of using memory-mapped I/O to access device control registers?
   CLOSED: [2018-01-10 Wed 11:19]
   The advantage of memory-mapped I/O is that it is simple to use and is faster
   to write bytes than to issue I/O instructions. The disadvantage is that it
   is vulnerable to accidental modification by means of an incorrect pointer to
   an unintended memory region.
** DONE 8. (4) Consider a hypothetical microprocessor having a 16-bit word size (for example, assume that the program counter and the address registers are 16 bits wide).
   CLOSED: [2018-01-17 Wed 15:00]
*** a. What is the maximum memory, in Bytes, that the processor can access directly if it is connected to a “16-bit wide memory” with a 16-bit data bus? [Hint: Stated another way, every time a read is done from RAM, the RAM delivers 16 bits, or 2 bytes of data.]
    131072 bytes
    131.072 Kbytes
    128 Bytes
*** b. What is the maximum memory, in Kbytes that the processor can access directly if it is connected to an “8-bit wide memory” with a 8-bit wide data bus?
    256 bytes
    .256 Kbytes
    .25 Kbytes
*** c. What architectural features will allow this microprocessor to access a separate “I/O space” (it would have a memory space and I/O space)?
    Special I/O instructions that specify the transfer of a byte or word to an
    I/O port address.
*** d. If separate input and output instructions can each specify which I/O port (usually there is one device for each I/O port) to select using an 8-bit I/O port number, how many I/O ports can the microprocessor support if the data path (data buss) to each I/O port is 8 bits wide? How many I/O ports can the microprocessor support if the data path is 16 bits wide? Explain.
    The format of the instruction might be like:
    | Bits indicating an IO instruction. | Register to read/write from/to | R/W | Port # that is 8 bits |
    - 256 : 2^8 devices
    - 65536 : 2^16 devices
** DONE 9. (2) In virtually all systems that include DMA modules, DMA access to main memory is given higher priority than processor access to main memory. Why?
   CLOSED: [2018-01-10 Wed 11:37]
   The CPU has caches to rely on for data items, and though /cycle stealing/
   can slow down the CPU computation, offloading the data-transfer work to a
   DMA controller generally improves the total system performance.
* DONE Homework 2 [6/6]
  CLOSED: [2018-01-22 Mon 11:35] DEADLINE: <2018-01-22 Mon>
** DONE 1.	(4) List six services provided by an operating system that are designed to make it more convenient for users to use the computer system.
   CLOSED: [2018-01-22 Mon 11:35]
   1. User Interface
   2. Error Detection
   3. File Systems
   4. Program Execution
   5. I/O Operations
   6. Communication
*** DONE Explain why it is not desirous to have the user level provide low-level file-system manipulation services that an operating system typically provides.
    CLOSED: [2018-01-19 Fri 15:14]
    Because the user doesn't have a full understanding of the uses of the
    kernel, they may accidently make an irreversible mistake. Instead, it would
    be better to only allow the user to do safe actions.
** DONE 2.	(2) What are the three general methods that are used for passing parameters to the operating system when a user's process makes a system call?
   CLOSED: [2018-01-19 Fri 14:59]
   1. Pass parameters in registers.
   2. Push parameters to the stack
   3. Store parameters in a block in memory and pass the address as the parameter
** DONE 3.	(3) What is the purpose of the command interpreter?
   CLOSED: [2018-01-19 Fri 14:55]
   It allows users to directly enter commands to be performed by the operating
   system.
*** DONE Why is it usually separate from the kernel?
    CLOSED: [2018-01-19 Fri 14:55]
    It is usually not part of the kernel since the command interpreter is
    subject to changes.
*** DONE Would it be possible for the user to develop a new command interpreter using the system-call interface provided by the operating system?
    CLOSED: [2018-01-19 Fri 14:56]
    Because you can create and manage processes and communicate between things
    from system calls, you could definitely make a new command interpreter.
    
** DONE 4.	(3) What are the two models of interprocess communication?
   CLOSED: [2018-01-19 Fri 14:47]
   Shared Memory and Message Passing
*** DONE What are the strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches?
    CLOSED: [2018-01-19 Fri 14:47]
    Message passing is useful for exchanging smaller amounts of data, because no
    conflicts need be avoided. It is also easier to implement. However, it is
    slow and is for smaller data exchanges.

    Shared Memory has the speed and size of main memory; however, it has
    problems relating to security and synchronization.
** DONE 5.	(4.5) What are the advantages of the microkernel approach to system design?
   CLOSED: [2018-01-19 Fri 14:49]
   It is smaller and easier to manage.
*** DONE How do user programs and system services interact in a microkernel architecture?
    CLOSED: [2018-01-19 Fri 14:48]
    Message passing
*** DONE What are the disadvantages of using the microkernel approach?
    CLOSED: [2018-01-19 Fri 14:48]
    The performance of mircokernels can suffer due to increased system-function
    overhead.
** DONE 6.	(2.5) What is the purpose of system calls, and how do system calls relate to the OS and to the concept of dual-mode (kernel mode and user mode) operation?
   CLOSED: [2018-01-22 Mon 11:35]
   System calls provide the means for a user program to ask the operating system
   to perform tasks reserved for the operating system on the user program’s
   behalf. When a system call is made this utilizes the dual mode of the
   operating system by switching from user mode to kernel mode.

  CPU scheduling (6.1 – 6.3.3)
** Notes
   - Preemptive scheduling :
     - When a process switches from the running state to the waiting state.
     - When a process switches from the running state to the ready state.
     - When a process switches from the waiting state to the ready state.
     - When a process terminates.
* DONE Lab 2
  CLOSED: [2018-01-27 Sat 22:34] DEADLINE: <2018-01-27 Sat>
** Conclusions
   - I was successful on the first part of the lab
   - I was successful on the second part of the lab
   - One difficulty I encountered was forgetting to add the '#define' to the
     '/usr/include/asm/unistd.h' file. This required that I reboot an extra time
     and trace my steps to make sure everything was placed properly.
   - I learned that modifications to the kernel are somewhat simple. I also
     learned that the kernel could be compiled and installed on a machine while
     it was running, but just requires a reboot for things changes to be made to
     the running kernel.
   - I think it would be easier to make a custom distribution on an ISO for this
     lab that way any desired virtual machine software could be used, as opposed
     to having to use VMware.

  CLOSED: [2018-01-26 Fri 09:36]
** DONE (2) What user actions or OS events/actions initiate the creation of a process on a system? [Note that question is not asking for what happens during the creation of a process.]
   CLOSED: [2018-01-22 Mon 16:01]
   Double-clicking the executable and running it from the command line
** DONE (4.5) Describe the differences between short-term, medium-term, and long-term scheduling.
   CLOSED: [2018-01-22 Mon 16:16]
   The main difference between schedulers is how often they are run:
   - Long-term : selects processes from the mass-storage device pool and loads
     them into memory for execution. Invoked infrequently
   - Short-term : Selects from among the processes that are ready to execute and
     allocates the CPU to one of them.
   - Medium-term : can be added if degree of multiple programming needs to
     decrease. Remove process from memory, store on disk, bring back in from
     disk to continue execution: swapping.
** DONE (3) Describe the actions taken by a kernel to context-switch between processes.
   CLOSED: [2018-01-26 Fri 09:14]
   When a context switch occurs, the kernel saves the context of the old process
   in its PCB and loads the saved context of the new process scheduled to run
   
   1. In response to a clock interrupt, the OS saves the PC and user stack
      pointer of the currently executing process, and transfers control to the
      kernel clock interrupt handler
   2. The clock interrupt handler saves the rest of the registers, as well as
      other machine state, such as the state of the floating point registers, in
      the process PCB.
   3. The OS invokes the scheduler to determine the next process to execute,
   4. The OS then retrieves the state of the next process from its PCB, and
      restores the registers. This restore operation takes the processor back to
      the state in which this process was previously interrupted, executing in
      user code with user mode privileges.

** DONE (3) Log in to a Linux lab node and do the following commands:

   - ps –efH
     - no output :(
*** DONE What do these commands show?
    CLOSED: [2018-01-26 Fri 09:36]

** DONE (2) What is swapping and what is its purpose?
   CLOSED: [2018-01-26 Fri 09:18]
   The key idea behind a medium-term scheduler is that sometimes it can be
   advantageous to remove a process from memory (and from active contention for
   the CPU ) and thus reduce the degree of multiprogramming. Later, the process
   can be reintroduced into memory, and its execution can be continued where it
   left off. This scheme is called swapping. The process is swapped out, and is
   later swapped in, by the medium-term scheduler. Swapping may be necessary to
   improve the process mix or because a change in memory requirements has
   overcommitted available memory, requiring memory to be freed up.

** DONE (2) In a number of early computers, an interrupt caused the register values to be stored in fixed locations associated with the given interrupt signal. Under what circumstances is this a practical technique? Explain why it is inconvenient in general.
   CLOSED: [2018-01-26 Fri 09:29]
   This technique is based on the assumption that an interrupted process /A/
   will continue to run after the response to an interrupt. But, in general, an
   interrupt may cause that basic monitor to preempt a process /A/ in favor of
   another process /B/. It is now necessary to copy the execution state of
   process /A/ from the location associated with the interrupt to the process
   description associated with /A/. The machine might as well have stored them
   there in the first place.

** DONE (1.5) When a process creates a new process using the fork() operation, which of the following state is shared between the parent process and the child process?
   CLOSED: [2018-01-24 Wed 10:31]
   - Stack
   - Heap
   - Shared memory segments
     The child inherits open files from its parent and pipes.
** DONE (2) Discuss at least two major complications that multiprogramming adds to an operating system.
   CLOSED: [2018-01-26 Fri 09:24]
   1. Multiprogramming requires complex scheduling in order to make sure all
      active processes get time on the processor.
   2. Multiprogramming requires each process to have its own memory, and which
      process has which block of memory must be managed.

** DONE What is usually the critical performance requirement in an interactive operating system?
   CLOSED: [2018-01-26 Fri 11:21]
   Adequate response time
** DONE What is the difference between turnaround time and response time?
   CLOSED: [2018-01-26 Fri 11:15]
   - Turnaround time : From the point of view of a particular process, the
     important criterion is how long it takes to execute that process. */The
     interval from the time of submission of a process to the time of completion
     is the turnaround time/*. Turnaround time is the sum of the periods spent
     waiting to get into memory, waiting in the ready queue, executing on the
     CPU, and doing I/O.
   - Response time : In an interactive system, turnaround time may not be the
     best criterion. Often, a process can produce some output fairly early and
     can continue computing new results while previous results are being output
     to the user. Thus, another measure is */the time from the submission of a
     request until the first response is produced/*. This measure, called
     response time, is the time it takes to start responding, not the time it
     takes to output the response. The turnaround time is generally limited by
     the speed of the output device.
** DONE What is the difference between preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling?

   large number of queues. A process moves to the next lower queue after
   receiving a single time quantum of service even if no other process is in the
   system.\\
   Note: 0, 5, 10, and all other time values are at one point in time. The
   vertical line under the 0 (zero) is where time starts. A process entering the
   system at time 0 is in the ready queue at time 0.

   This following question use the [[http://www.training.com.br/sosim/indexen.htm][SOsim: Simulator for Operating Systems
   Education]] to explore topics and issues dealing with processes and CPU
   scheduling.

   To get started, download and unzip the SOsim program
   ([[http://www.training.com.br/sosim/indexen.htm]] or from Blackboard). Run SOsim
   and explore the various menus and buttons to become familiar with the
   simulator and the statistics it provides.

   Use SOsim to answer the questions below. You might wish to get together with
   other students in the class, after you have individually worked on the
   questions, to discuss what you have learned and to determine your answers.

   Tips for using SOsim: 

   - SOsim doesn't run well on some new PCs with faster processors and lots of
     memory

   - The log window provides some useful information.

   - Some of the statistics in SOsim are of questionable quality or are not what
     you might think they should be.

   - Stopping the simulator, creating processes, and then letting the simulator
     run for a certain amount of time before stopping it again, might prove
     helpful.

   - You may need to exit and restart the simulator before each simulation run.
     /This is especially true when changing options./

   - If priorities are different, your results will vary depending on whether you
     start the IO or CPU job first.

** DONE No Priority Scheduling
   CLOSED: [2018-01-31 Wed 14:07]

   There are a couple of scheduling priority options that are accessed with the
   "Options" menu of the "Processor Manager" window; make sure they are both
   turned off and that you restart SOsim after turning them off. With the options
   off, create two processes, one CPU-bound and the other IO-bound (IO\_1) at
   priority 0, and simulate round-robin scheduling without priority. Run with
   some different settings for "IO wait time" and "Timeslice." What settings
   create the largest waits for processes in the ready queue? Describe what
   settings you used and what results were obtained. Take a look at the various
   windows available under the "Windows" menu.
   
   Minimize IO wait time and maximize time slice, minimize clock

** DONE Starvation
   CLOSED: [2018-01-31 Wed 14:25]

   Using only two processes, simulate starvation. Describe what you did and why
   it produced starvation. What criteria might be utilized to define process
   priority to help prevent starvation?
   
   One process has maximum priority, and the other doesn't. A possible solution
   to starvation is to use a scheduling algorithm with priority queue that also
   uses the aging technique. Aging is a technique of gradually increasing the
   priority of processes that wait in the system for a long time.

** DONE Static Priority Scheduling
   CLOSED: [2018-01-31 Wed 14:30]

   Enable priority preemptive scheduling (dynamic priority scheduling should be
   off; stop and restart SOsim) and create a CPU-bound process at priority level
   three and an IO-bound (IO\_1) process with a priority level of four. What is
   happening? How does this situation compare with that done in item seven? How
   does changing the IO wait time and timeslice affect the simulation?
   
   The CPU process will give way to the IO process and at the end of it's
   timeslice, because it has priority.

** DONE Dynamic Priority Scheduling
   CLOSED: [2018-01-31 Wed 14:35]

   Create three or more processes and run a simulation using dynamic priority
   scheduling (turn off priority preemptive scheduling and restart). What does
   this do? What is the difference between process types IO\_1, IO\_2 and IO\_3?
   Is it possible to starve a process when using dynamic priority scheduling with
   SOsim? [Hint: it helps to start all the processes with the same priority and
   have a CPU bound process in the mix.]
   
   The different inputs have different set priorities, or IO1 is priority 1
   input to 3 and it looks like if enough higher priority IOs exist then the CPU
   bound process is starved.

** DONE (3) Explain how a multithreaded application may provide better performance than a single-threaded application even on a single-processor system.
   CLOSED: [2018-02-05 Mon 16:13]
   When a kernel thread suffers a page fault, another kernel thread can be
   switched in to use the interleaving time in a useful manner. A
   single-threaded process, on the other hand, will not be capable of performing
   useful work when a page fault takes place. Therefore, in scenarios where a
   program might suffer from frequent page faults or has to wait for other
   system events, a multi-threaded solution would perform better even on a
   single-processor system.
** DONE (2) Which of the following components of program state are shared across threads in a multithreaded process? (There may be more than one.)

** DONE (3) Discuss three advantages of user-level threads (ULTs) over kernel-level threads (KLTs).
   CLOSED: [2018-02-05 Mon 16:00]
   - Thread scheduling does not involved the OS, thus no system calls with the associated user/kernel mode switching is done.
   - Scheduling may be very application specific.
   - Faster to create, manage, and destroy.
   - May run on any OS

** DONE (2) Discuss two disadvantages of user-level threads (ULTs) over kernel-level threads (KLTs).
   CLOSED: [2018-02-05 Mon 16:04]
   - Blocks for I/O could block the entire process along with all user-level threads.

** DONE (3) A Solaris thread which is currently running on a CPU may voluntarily give up the CPU to another thread. Which of the following statements is correct:
   CLOSED: [2018-02-07 Wed 14:38]

   1. A Solaris user-level thread (ULT) may yield to another thread of the same priority.

   *
   2. A Solaris user-level thread (ULT) may yield to another thread of the same priority or higher priority.
   *

   3. A Solaris user-level thread (ULT) may yield to another thread of the same priority, a lower priority, or higher priority.

   Assume that anytime the priority of a thread in the system might change, the user-level thread scheduler is called to determine which process gets the processor. [Help: you might look at the sched_yield (which is for kernel threads, but might still be helpful) by doing: man 2 sched_yield.]

   Explain why you chose the one you did.
   
   Because yielding would allow the next in line to go, but not necessarily the
   next in a lower priority line.

** DONE (4) What are the requirements that a solution to the critical-section problem must satisfy? Explain each one briefly.
   CLOSED: [2018-02-12 Mon 15:36]

   1. Mutual exclusion. If process P i is executing in its critical section,
      then no other processes can be executing in their critical sections.

   2. Progress. If no process is executing in its critical section and some
      processes wish to enter their critical sections, then only those processes
      that are not executing in their remainder sections can participate in
      deciding which will enter its critical section next, and this selection
      cannot be postponed indefinitely.

   3. Bounded waiting. There exists a bound, or limit, on the number of times
      that other processes are allowed to enter their critical sections after a
      process has made a request to enter its critical section and before that
      request is granted.

   #+BEGIN_SRC C++

     const int n=50;
     int tally; //global variable

       for (count = 1; count <= n; count++)

     }
   #+END_SRC

   Determine the proper lower bound and upper bound on the final value of the
   shared variable tally output by this concurrent program running on a
   uni-processor. Assume a thread can execute at any relative speed and that a
   value can only be incremented after it has been loaded into a register by a
   separate machine instruction. Assume also that a load is done before the
   increment and a store is done after the increment.
   

   [For most of the credit on this problem, show that you put some thought in to it.]

   Hint: The assembly language instruction stream might be:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     load mem -> reg1 
     incr reg1
     store reg1 -> mem
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   Suppose that an arbitrary number of these threads are permitted to execute in
   parallel under the assumptions of part (a). What effect will this
   modification have on the range of final values of tally?

   a. 2 \geq x \geq 50
   b. n \geq x \geq 50
** DONE (2) Explain why implementing synchronization primitives by disabling interrupts is not appropriate in a single-processor system if the synchronization primitives are to be used in user-level programs. [i.e. User programs disable interrupts when executing synchronization primitives.]
   CLOSED: [2018-02-14 Wed 11:55]
   If a user-level program is given the ability to disable interrupts, then it
   can disable the timer interrupt and prevent context switching from taking
   place, thereby allowing it to use the processor without letting other
   processes to execute.
** DONE (2) Servers can be designed to limit the number of open connections. For example, a server may wish to have only N socket connections at any point in time. As soon as N connections are made, the server will not accept another incoming connection until an existing connection is released. Explain how semaphores can be used by a server to limit the number of concurrent connections.
   CLOSED: [2018-02-14 Wed 11:55]
   A semaphore is initialized to the number of allowable open socket
   connections. When a connection is accepted, the acquire() method is called;
   when a connection is released, the release() method is called. If the system
   reaches the number of allowable socket connections, subsequent calls to
   acquire() will block until an existing connection is terminated and the
   release method is invoked.
** DONE (2) How does the signal() operation associated with monitors differ from the corresponding operation defined for semaphores?
   CLOSED: [2018-02-14 Wed 14:19]
   Signal on a monitor does nothing if there is no one waiting; however, with
   the semaphore we still increment the counter.

   CLOSED: [2018-02-16 Fri 14:22]
   - Mutual exclusion. At least one resource must be held in a nonsharable mode;
     that is, only one process at a time can use the resource. If another
     process requests that resource, the requesting process must be delayed
     until the resource has been released.
   - Hold and wait. A process must be holding at least one resource and waiting
     to acquire additional resources that are currently being held by other
     processes.
   - No preemption. Resources cannot be preempted; that is, a resource can be
     released only voluntarily by the process holding it, after that process has
     completed its task.
   - Circular wait. A set {P 0 , P 1 , ..., P n } of waiting processes must
     exist such that P 0 is waiting for a resource held by P 1 , P 1 is waiting
     for a resource held by P 2 , ..., P n−1 is waiting for a resource held by P
     n , and P n is waiting for a resource held by P 0 .

** TODO (3) [[file:3.jpeg][file:~/classes/cs345/3.jpeg]] 
   A spooling system (figure above) consists of an input process I, a processing
   process P, and an output process O connected by two buffers. The processes
   exchange data in blocks of equal size. These blocks are buffered on a disk
   using a floating boundary between the input and the output buffers depending
   on the speed of the processes. The communication primitives used ensure that
   the following resource constraint is satisfied:

   i + o < max

   where:
   - max = maximum number of blocks on disk
   - i = number of blocks used on the disk for the input buffer
   - o = number of blocks used on the disk for the output buffer

   The following is known about the processes:

   - As long as the environment supplies data, process I will eventually input
     it to the input buffer on the disk (provided disk space becomes available).
   - As long as there is an item(s) in the input buffer on the disk, process P
     will eventually consume it and output a finite amount of data to the output
     buffer on the disk for each block input (provided disk space becomes
     available).
   - As long as there is an item in the output buffer, process O will eventually
     consume it.

   Show that this system can be deadlocked.
   
** TODO (2) Suggest an additional resource constraint that will prevent the deadlock in problem 3; but still permit the boundary between input and output buffers to vary in accordance with the present needs of the processes.
** TODO (3) Three processes share four instances of an identical resource. The resource instances can only be reserved and released one at a time. Each process needs a maximum of two units. Show that a deadlock cannot occur.

** TODO (4.5) Consider a system with memory mapping done on a page basis and using a single-level page table. Assume that the necessary page table is always in memory.
*** If a memory reference takes 200 ns, how long does it take to reference (or access) a memory location using the page table (a paged memory reference)?
*** Now we add an MMU that imposes an overhead (additional time) of 20 ns on each memory reference if it is a hit or a miss. If we assume that 85% of all memory references hit in the MMU TLB, what is the effective memory access time (EMAT)? [A memory reference to access the page table on a miss does not incur the time to access the TLB.]
*** Generally speaking, what is the relationship between TLB hit rate and EMAT?

** TODO (3) Suppose the page table for the process currently executing on the processor looks like the following. All numbers are decimal, everything is numbered starting from zero, and all addresses are memory byte addresses. The page size is 1024 bytes.

|           Virtual page number | Valid bit | Page frame number              |
|-------------------------------+-----------+--------------------------------|
| (virtual address 0 - 1023)  0 |         1 | 4                              |
|                             1 |         1 | 7                              |
|                             2 |         0 | -                              |
|                             3 |         1 | 2                              |
|                             4 |         0 | -                              |
|                             5 |         1 | (physical address 0 - 1023)  0 |

*** What physical address, if any would each of the following virtual addresses correspond to? (Do not try to handle page faults, if any, just indicate that there would be a page fault.)
