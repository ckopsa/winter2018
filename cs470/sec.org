    Please familiarize yourself with the various types of software weapons. Note
    that the classification scheme presented here is not mutually-exclusive;
    some software weapons belong to more than one type. After reading this
    chapter, you should be able to recite the types of software weapons,
    enumerate the properties, and classify a given software weapon.

* TODO Research 03 [0/1]
  DEADLINE: <2018-01-24 Wed>
  - [ ] Look at the requirements for the research paper and start a plan
* TODO Ponder 03: Malware Research
  DEADLINE: <2018-01-27 Sat>
  Identify a recent malware outbreak. Find three sources and write a "one page"
  report of the malware. Additionally, read another's report, find an additional
  source, and make a "meaningful contribution" to the report.
** TODO Initial Report
   First, choose a recent malware outbreak. This could be anything within the past
   half-decade or so. Please do not choose anything from last century. Usually
   students do best when they choose a topic that is interesting to them.

   Find three sources describing the outbreak. These should be secondary or primary
   sources only. If you are unsure if a source is secondary or preliminary, check
   the qualifications of the author. If the author's job description is "staff
   writer," he or she is probably not a recognized expert. On the other hand, if
   the article is published in a peer-reviewed journal such as IEEE or ACM, then it
   is at least a secondary source.

   Finally, write a "one page" report of the malware. Make sure the report is fully
   cited. Also make sure the grammar and spelling are professional. There should be
   no first-person ("I") or second-person ("you") in the article. Please refer to
   the Scholarly Writing page for details.

   Your post will be graded according to the following scale:
   - 50pt: "There is nothing to add," the writing is "professional"
   - 45pt: All the requirements are met. Great sources coupled with an essay how the information from the source contributes to the issues in the discussion
   - 35pt: One flaw in the report: grammatical or spelling mistake, weak source, key point missing, or problems with the writing quality
   - 25pt: Serious problem with the report: grammatical or spelling errors making the article difficult to read, poor or missing sources, opinions, off-base comments, comments with factual errors, or major parts of the malware outbreak are not discussed
   - 0pt: Article missing or does not demonstrate a significant amount of effort on the part of the author

** TODO Meaningful Contribution
   Please also read the report of a classmate. Find at least one additional source
   and make a "meaningful contribution" to the report. This component will be
   graded the same as the initial report:
   - 50pt: The contribution is "outstanding"
   - 45pt: All the requirements are met. Great sources coupled with an essay how the information from the source contributes to the issues in the discussion
   - 35pt: One flaw in the report: grammatical or spelling mistake, weak source, key point missing, or problems with the writing quality
   - 25pt: Serious problem with the report: grammatical or spelling errors making the article difficult to read, poor or missing sources, opinions, off-base comments, comments with factual errors, or major parts of the malware outbreak are not discussed
   - 0pt: Article missing or does not demonstrate a significant amount of effort on the part of the author
