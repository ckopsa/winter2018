** TODO Reading [0/5]
   The reading for this week will include one long chapter from the textbook and
   four additional articles.
*** TODO Software Weapons
    Please familiarize yourself with the various types of software weapons. Note
    that the classification scheme presented here is not mutually-exclusive;
    some software weapons belong to more than one type. After reading this
    chapter, you should be able to recite the types of software weapons,
    enumerate the properties, and classify a given software weapon.
*** TODO The Internet Worm Program: An Analysis
    Another classic work. The most interesting thing here is the investigation
    that was conducted. You do not need to read the entire article, but you may
    choose to.

*** TODO Reflections on Trusting Trust
    This very short article describes how to create an invisible virus.

*** TODO The Zombie Roundup
    This paper does a good job of describing botnets.

    Disrupting Botnets", SRUTI'05 Proceedings, pp 6-6 [Online] Available:

*** TODO The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine
    If there ever was a paper that was required reading for any technical
    professional, this one is it! You may find the authors of this paper
    familiar. If not, you certainly will know about the company they started
    based on this technology. If not, you should "Google it>"

** TODO Quiz
   As with last week, don't forget to take the quiz. The highest score will be
   the recorded score.
* TODO Research 03 [0/1]
  DEADLINE: <2018-01-24 Wed>
  - [ ] Look at the requirements for the research paper and start a plan
* TODO Ponder 03: Malware Research
  DEADLINE: <2018-01-27 Sat>
  Identify a recent malware outbreak. Find three sources and write a "one page"
  report of the malware. Additionally, read another's report, find an additional
  source, and make a "meaningful contribution" to the report.
** TODO Initial Report
   First, choose a recent malware outbreak. This could be anything within the past
   half-decade or so. Please do not choose anything from last century. Usually
   students do best when they choose a topic that is interesting to them.

   Find three sources describing the outbreak. These should be secondary or primary
   sources only. If you are unsure if a source is secondary or preliminary, check
   the qualifications of the author. If the author's job description is "staff
   writer," he or she is probably not a recognized expert. On the other hand, if
   the article is published in a peer-reviewed journal such as IEEE or ACM, then it
   is at least a secondary source.

   Finally, write a "one page" report of the malware. Make sure the report is fully
   cited. Also make sure the grammar and spelling are professional. There should be
   no first-person ("I") or second-person ("you") in the article. Please refer to
   the Scholarly Writing page for details.

   Your post will be graded according to the following scale:
   - 50pt: "There is nothing to add," the writing is "professional"
   - 45pt: All the requirements are met. Great sources coupled with an essay how the information from the source contributes to the issues in the discussion
   - 35pt: One flaw in the report: grammatical or spelling mistake, weak source, key point missing, or problems with the writing quality
   - 25pt: Serious problem with the report: grammatical or spelling errors making the article difficult to read, poor or missing sources, opinions, off-base comments, comments with factual errors, or major parts of the malware outbreak are not discussed
   - 0pt: Article missing or does not demonstrate a significant amount of effort on the part of the author

** TODO Meaningful Contribution
   Please also read the report of a classmate. Find at least one additional source
   and make a "meaningful contribution" to the report. This component will be
   graded the same as the initial report:
   - 50pt: The contribution is "outstanding"
   - 45pt: All the requirements are met. Great sources coupled with an essay how the information from the source contributes to the issues in the discussion
   - 35pt: One flaw in the report: grammatical or spelling mistake, weak source, key point missing, or problems with the writing quality
   - 25pt: Serious problem with the report: grammatical or spelling errors making the article difficult to read, poor or missing sources, opinions, off-base comments, comments with factual errors, or major parts of the malware outbreak are not discussed
   - 0pt: Article missing or does not demonstrate a significant amount of effort on the part of the author
